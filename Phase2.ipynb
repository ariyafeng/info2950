    "- The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data using a variety of methods including surveys and censuses. There is a fine for inaccurately  filling out a census, but it is still possible for people to  report inaccurately which would result in certain things being recorded and others not. There are also some people usually undocumented immigrants who donâ€™t fill out a census which could result in inaccurate data collection. \n",

    "- People are well aware of the data being collected. The collection of data relies on peoples submission of required surveys and censuses. As stated earlier, everyone is required to fill out the census (citizens and noncitizens) and failure to do so results in fines. \n",
